# Project_1_Twitter_Scraper
Scrapping Data from Twitter based on user input.
I used snscrape, pymongo, pandas, streamlit, datetime modules for this project.
snscrape: snscrape is used to scrape the data from the social media. From Twitter it scrapes things like user, id, content, likescount, retweetCount, hashtags,etc.

Pandas is used to create a dataframe.

Streamlit is used to create a web application.
