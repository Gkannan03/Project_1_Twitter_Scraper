# Project_1_Twitter_Scraper
Scrapping Data from Twitter based on user input.
I used snscrape, pymongo, pandas, streamlit, datetime modules for this project.
snscrape: snscrape is used to scrape the data from the social media. From Twitter it scrapes things like user, id, content, likescount, retweetCount, hashtags,etc.
  pip3 install snscrape --> used to install snscrape package in python
pymongo is used to connect python with mongodb database.
Pandas is used to create a dataframe. 
Streamlit is used to create a web application.
